# Flask_Berry
This project will just help me to learn Python/ Flask.
The main use-case is to provide a searchable library for things like ebooks and your wealth of music.

This should be rather helpful for at least me since I tend to purchase a lot of books from
Humble Bundle and tend to not find the useful ones again.
Also for some reason music players tend to mark artists collaborating as a "new" artist which
makes searching for a certain artist's songs a pain in the ass.

To provide the searching the project will rely on ElasticSearch.
Let's see how fast I finish this and how many PEPs I'll violate.
