# Flask_Berry
This project will just help me to learn Python/ Flask. The main use-case is to provide a searchable library for things
like ebooks and your wealth of music.

This should be rather helpful for at least me since I tend to purchase a lot of books from Humble Bundle and tend to not
find the useful ones again. Also, for some reason music players tend to mark artists collaborating as a "new" artist
which makes searching for a certain artist's songs a pain in the ass.

To provide the searching the project will rely on ElasticSearch (or just my good old plain sqlite). Let's see how fast I
finish this and how many PEPs I'll violate. One reason why this project is taking a while is that my power supply
decided to commit sudoku ((ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻)after 4 weeks of use. The process of replacing it via the guarantee took me like 2
months.

## Testing

`pip install -e .` in the root directory, followed by `pytest`
